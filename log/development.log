Testing, and testing, did a basic Fullstack <a href=\"https://github.com/alexertech/fullstack_playground\">MEAN</a> application just to learn Mongo / Express / Angular / Node. A fun project but still not what I was looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, I found an old tutorial for a basic blog that I wrote many years ago, using Scaffolding and lots of Rails fun. A quick n' dirty tutorial since was based on the basic Rails demonstration that has been around for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this blog version, I updated that tutorial implementing better security features, like the use of strong passwords and auth systems, better routing and even session management. It's really awesome how rails simplifies everything. A true <em>\"relax n' code\"</em> for the development process. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there is more code cleaning and features to add, but this is the base, and you can find the code on <a href=\"https://github.com/alexertech/rails_blog\">my github</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy and happy codding :)</p>", "tag_list"=>"thoughts"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"2"}

Ill be using KALI 32bits, so my codes and samples will always refer to the 32 bits registers. \r\n\r\nA 32-bit Linux Flavor, runs in protected mode, has flat memory model, and uses the ELF format for binaries.\r\n\r\n### Our first code\r\n\r\nGrab your favorite editor (nano, vim, gedit) and lets write ASM code. \r\n\r\nA program can be divided into sections: .text for your code (read-only), .data for your data (read-write), .bss for uninitialized data (read-write); there can actually be a few other standard sections, as well as some user-defined sections, but there's rare need to use them and they are out of our interest here. Any program must have at least .text section.\r\n\r\nCreate a file called \"hello.asm\" with this content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsection     .text\r\nglobal      _start                ;must be declared for linker (ld)\r\n\r\n_start:                           ;tell linker entry point\r\n\r\n    mov     edx,len               ;edx will hold the message length\r\n    mov     ecx,msg               ;ecx hold the message to write\r\n    mov     ebx,1                 ;file descriptor (stdout)\r\n    mov     eax,4                 ;system call number (sys_write)\r\n    int     0x80                  ;call kernel\r\n\r\n    mov     eax,1                 ;system call number (sys_exit)\r\n    int     0x80                  ;call kernel\r\n\r\nsection     .data                 ; where we store our vars\r\n\r\n    msg     db  'Hello, world!',0xa             ;the string\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file, and lets produce the ELF object file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nasm -f elf hello.asm \r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the linker we can produce the executable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ld -s -o hello hello.o \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, run the program:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./hello \r\nHello, world!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Know your registers\r\n\r\n**EDX** : data, this is an extension of the EAX register. It allows for more complex calculations (multiply, divide) by allowing extra data to be stored to facilitate those calculations. In this sample, we will use it to store the location of the message length.\r\n\r\n**ECX** : counter, used for iterations. ECX counts downward, and again being used just to store the message location.\r\n\r\n**EBX** : base (does not have anything to do with base pointer). It has no general purpose and can be used to store data, and for us will be use the stdout (show the output directly on the terminal).\r\n\r\n**EAX** : accumulator, used for performing calculations, and used to store return values from function calls. Basic operations such as add, subtract, compare use this general-purpose register. We will use a lot the EAX register later, but here we will store the system call number.\r\n\r\n**DB**  : Declare a byte, referred to as location (msg), containing the value 'Hello, world!'.\r\n\r\n**EQU** : The EQU directive is used for defining constants and can be expressions. In this case store the length of the msg. \r\n\r\n\r\n## About System calls\r\n\r\nWe use a direct kernel call (int 0x80), since this is the fastest way to call kernel service. Also, our code is not linked to any library, does not use ELF interpreter, it communicates with kernel directly.\r\n\r\nUnless a program is just implementing some math algorithms in assembly, it will deal with such things as getting input, producing output, and exiting. For this, it will need to call on OS services. In fact, programming in assembly language is quite the same in different OSes, unless OS services are touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n", "tag_list"=>"test"}, "commit"=>"Send"}

Any program must have at least .text section.\r\n\r\nCreate a file called \"hello.asm\" with this content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsection     .text\r\nglobal      _start                ;must be declared for linker (ld)\r\n\r\n_start:                           ;tell linker entry point\r\n\r\n    mov     edx,len               ;edx will hold the message length\r\n    mov     ecx,msg               ;ecx hold the message to write\r\n    mov     ebx,1                 ;file descriptor (stdout)\r\n    mov     eax,4                 ;system call number (sys_write)\r\n    int     0x80                  ;call kernel\r\n\r\n    mov     eax,1                 ;system call number (sys_exit)\r\n    int     0x80                  ;call kernel\r\n\r\nsection     .data                 ; where we store our vars\r\n\r\n    msg     db  'Hello, world!',0xa             ;the string\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file, and lets produce the ELF object file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nasm -f elf hello.asm \r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the linker we can produce the executable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ld -s -o hello hello.o \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, run the program:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./hello \r\nHello, world!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Know your registers\r\n\r\n**EDX** : data, this is an extension of the EAX register. It allows for more complex calculations (multiply, divide) by allowing extra data to be stored to facilitate those calculations. In this sample, we will use it to store the location of the message length.\r\n\r\n**ECX** : counter, used for iterations. ECX counts downward, and again being used just to store the message location.\r\n\r\n**EBX** : base (does not have anything to do with base pointer). It has no general purpose and can be used to store data, and for us will be use the stdout (show the output directly on the terminal).\r\n\r\n**EAX** : accumulator, used for performing calculations, and used to store return values from function calls. Basic operations such as add, subtract, compare use this general-purpose register. We will use a lot the EAX register later, but here we will store the system call number.\r\n\r\n**DB**  : Declare a byte, referred to as location (msg), containing the value 'Hello, world!'.\r\n\r\n**EQU** : The EQU directive is used for defining constants and can be expressions. In this case store the length of the msg. \r\n\r\n\r\n## About System calls\r\n\r\nWe use a direct kernel call (int 0x80), since this is the fastest way to call kernel service. Also, our code is not linked to any library, does not use ELF interpreter, it communicates with kernel directly.\r\n\r\nUnless a program is just implementing some math algorithms in assembly, it will deal with such things as getting input, producing output, and exiting. For this, it will need to call on OS services. In fact, programming in assembly language is quite the same in different OSes, unless OS services are touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"], ["created_at", 2017-02-02 01:41:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-02 01:41:57 UTC]]

It allows for more complex calculations (multiply, divide) by allowing extra data to be stored to facilitate those calculations. In this sample, we will use it to store the location of the message length.\r\n\r\n**ECX** : counter, used for iterations. ECX counts downward, and again being used just to store the message location.\r\n\r\n**EBX** : base (does not have anything to do with base pointer). It has no general purpose and can be used to store data, and for us will be use the stdout (show the output directly on the terminal).\r\n\r\n**EAX** : accumulator, used for performing calculations, and used to store return values from function calls. Basic operations such as add, subtract, compare use this general-purpose register. We will use a lot the EAX register later, but here we will store the system call number.\r\n\r\n**DB**  : Declare a byte, referred to as location (msg), containing the value 'Hello, world!'.\r\n\r\n**EQU** : The EQU directive is used for defining constants and can be expressions. In this case store the length of the msg. \r\n\r\n\r\n## About System calls\r\n\r\nWe use a direct kernel call (int 0x80), since this is the fastest way to call kernel service. Also, our code is not linked to any library, does not use ELF interpreter, it communicates with kernel directly.\r\n\r\nUnless a program is just implementing some math algorithms in assembly, it will deal with such things as getting input, producing output, and exiting. For this, it will need to call on OS services. In fact, programming in assembly language is quite the same in different OSes, unless OS services are touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n", "tag_list"=>"test"}, "commit"=>"Send"}

Also keep in mind that the registers have different names according to the architecture.  For example, the Instruction Pointer is called IP on 16 bits, EIP on 32 bits and RIP on 64bits. Ill be using KALI 32bits, so my codes and samples will always refer to the 32 bits registers. \r\n\r\nA 32-bit Linux Flavor, runs in protected mode, has flat memory model, and uses the ELF format for binaries.\r\n\r\n### Our first code\r\n\r\nGrab your favorite editor (nano, vim, gedit) and lets write ASM code. \r\n\r\nA program can be divided into sections: .text for your code (read-only), .data for your data (read-write), .bss for uninitialized data (read-write); there can actually be a few other standard sections, as well as some user-defined sections, but there's rare need to use them and they are out of our interest here. Any program must have at least .text section.\r\n\r\nCreate a file called \"hello.asm\" with this content:\r\n\r\n```asm\r\nsection     .text\r\nglobal      _start                ;must be declared for linker (ld)\r\n\r\n_start:                           ;tell linker entry point\r\n\r\n    mov     edx,len               ;edx will hold the message length\r\n    mov     ecx,msg               ;ecx hold the message to write\r\n    mov     ebx,1                 ;file descriptor (stdout)\r\n    mov     eax,4                 ;system call number (sys_write)\r\n    int     0x80                  ;call kernel\r\n\r\n    mov     eax,1                 ;system call number (sys_exit)\r\n    int     0x80                  ;call kernel\r\n\r\nsection     .data                 ; where we store our vars\r\n\r\n    msg     db  'Hello, world!',0xa             ;the string\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file, and lets produce the ELF object file:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ nasm -f elf hello.asm \r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the linker we can produce the executable:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ld -s -o hello hello.o \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, run the program:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ ./hello \r\nHello, world!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Know your registers\r\n\r\n**EDX** : data, this is an extension of the EAX register. It allows for more complex calculations (multiply, divide) by allowing extra data to be stored to facilitate those calculations. In this sample, we will use it to store the location of the message length.\r\n\r\n**ECX** : counter, used for iterations. ECX counts downward, and again being used just to store the message location.\r\n\r\n**EBX** : base (does not have anything to do with base pointer). It has no general purpose and can be used to store data, and for us will be use the stdout (show the output directly on the terminal).\r\n\r\n**EAX** : accumulator, used for performing calculations, and used to store return values from function calls. Basic operations such as add, subtract, compare use this general-purpose register. We will use a lot the EAX register later, but here we will store the system call number.\r\n\r\n**DB**  : Declare a byte, referred to as location (msg), containing the value 'Hello, world!'.\r\n\r\n**EQU** : The EQU directive is used for defining constants and can be expressions. In this case store the length of the msg. \r\n\r\n\r\n## About System calls\r\n\r\nWe use a direct kernel call (int 0x80), since this is the fastest way to call kernel service. Also, our code is not linked to any library, does not use ELF interpreter, it communicates with kernel directly.\r\n\r\nUnless a program is just implementing some math algorithms in assembly, it will deal with such things as getting input, producing output, and exiting. For this, it will need to call on OS services. In fact, programming in assembly language is quite the same in different OSes, unless OS services are touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n", "tag_list"=>"abc"}, "commit"=>"Send"}

You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-10 19:10:50 UTC], ["id", 6]]

You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-10 19:11:53 UTC], ["id", 6]]

And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-10 19:12:10 UTC], ["id", 6]]

You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-10 19:14:05 UTC], ["id", 6]]

Lets focus on the interesting parts:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484c4 <+25>:\tcall   0x8048360 <printf@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484db <+48>:\tcall   0x8048370 <fgets@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+78>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x0804850d <+98>:\tcall   0x8048380 <puts@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x0804851f <+116>:\tcall   0x8048380 <puts@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x08048531 <+134>:\tcall   0x8048380 <puts@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\nMuch better. You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

Lets focus on the interesting parts:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484c4 <+25>:\tcall   0x8048360 <printf@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484db <+48>:\tcall   0x8048370 <fgets@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+78>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x0804850d <+98>:\tcall   0x8048380 <puts@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x0804851f <+116>:\tcall   0x8048380 <puts@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n   0x08048531 <+134>:\tcall   0x8048380 <puts@plt>\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\nMuch better. You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nWhat is interesting here is the first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5wx 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\nUsing \"x/5wx\" we dump the memory 5 addresses from the from the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, counting from our suspicious address until we find a null byte (00), we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (little-endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we quickly found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still too much to learn from GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, I don't want to give too much at this time so you can go and do more testing by your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to crack this in a really simple way, use the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII strings characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-10 19:14:37 UTC], ["id", 6]]

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nThe first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5x 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the command \"x/5x\" we dump the memory 5 items from  the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, taking as beginning our suspicious address and the end the NULL character, we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (because... endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still plenty of commands to play with GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, lets take it slow. \r\n\r\n**The most simple way** to crack something like this could be using the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII  characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-12 02:05:08 UTC], ["id", 6]]

You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program, the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nThe first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5x 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the command \"x/5x\" we dump the memory 5 items from  the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, taking as beginning our suspicious address and the end the NULL character, we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (because... endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 00  41 63 63\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d | NL   A  c  c \r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\nMore simple? Use the command \"x/s\" and gdb will dump a zero-terminated string:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/s 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t\"p4ssw0rd\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still plenty of commands to play with GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, lets take it slow. \r\n\r\n**The most simple way** to crack something like this could be using the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII  characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nThe first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5x 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the command \"x/5x\" we dump the memory 5 items from  the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, taking as beginning our suspicious address and the end the NULL character, we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (because... endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 00  41 63 63\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d | NL   A  c  c \r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\nMore simple? Use the command \"x/s\" and gdb will dump a zero-terminated string:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/s 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t\"p4ssw0rd\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still plenty of commands to play with GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, lets take it slow. \r\n\r\n**The most simple way** to crack something like this could be using the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII  characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-12 03:51:06 UTC], ["id", 6]]

You can see the function names right there, and compare with the original code, but thinking like if we don't have the source code of this program, the first thing that caught my attention was the **strcmp**, a function that compares two strings. \r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments (see: man 3 strcmp), so we must put special attention to the couple of **push** instructions before the call. This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nThe first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5x 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the command \"x/5x\" we dump the memory 5 items from  the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, taking as beginning our suspicious address and the end the NULL character, we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (because... endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 00  41 63 63\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d | NL   A  c  c \r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\nMore simple? Use the command \"x/s\" and gdb will dump a zero-terminated string:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/s 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t\"p4ssw0rd\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still plenty of commands to play with GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, lets take it slow. \r\n\r\n**The most simple way** to crack something like this could be using the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII  characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!", "tag_list"=>"exploitation basics, assembler, reverse engineering"}, "commit"=>"Send", "id"=>"6"}

This push instructions are placing on the memory the values required for the comparator.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   0x080484f0 <+61>:\tpush   0x80485e5\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f8 <+69>:\tpush   eax\r\n(...)\r\n   0x080484f9 <+70>:\tcall   0x8048350 <strcmp@plt>\r\n```\r\nThe first **push** refers to a memory location already defined. \r\n\r\nWhat's in that address?\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/5x 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t0x73733470\t0x64723077\t0x63634100\t0x20737365\r\n0x80485f5:\t0x6e617247\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the command \"x/5x\" we dump the memory 5 items from  the one entered as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, taking as beginning our suspicious address and the end the NULL character, we can translate this to ASCII and see what we have found:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nhex   : 73 73 34 70 | 64 72 30 77 | 63 63 41 00\r\nascii :  s  s  4  p |  d  r  0  w |  c  c  A  NULL\r\n\r\nreverse (because... endian)\r\n\r\nhex   : 70 34 73 73 | 77 30 72 64 | 00  41 63 63\r\nascii :  p  4  s  s |  w  0  r  d | NL   A  c  c \r\n```\r\nBoom! And just like that, we found the \"hidden\" password. \r\n\r\nMore simple? Use the command \"x/s\" and gdb will dump a zero-terminated string:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n(gdb) x/s 0x80485e5\r\n0x80485e5:\t\"p4ssw0rd\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nThere is still plenty of commands to play with GDB debugging, since this are just the first baby steps on the reverse engineering world, lets take it slow. \r\n\r\n**The most simple way** to crack something like this could be using the command \"strings\" and just dump all the ASCII  characters from the binary.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ strings crackme\r\n\r\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2\r\nlibc.so.6\r\n_IO_stdin_used\r\nputs\r\nstdin\r\nprintf\r\nfgets\r\nstrcmp\r\n__libc_start_main\r\n__gmon_start__\r\nGLIBC_2.0\r\nPTRh\r\nUWVS\r\nt$,U\r\n[^_]\r\nEnter the password: \r\np4ssw0rd                ;----- LOL\r\nAccess Granted!\r\nWRONG!\r\nYou must type a password \r\n;*2$\"(\r\nGCC: (Debian 5.3.1-10) 5.3.1 20160224\r\ncrtstuff.c\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"], ["updated_at", 2017-02-12 03:51:23 UTC], ["id", 6]]

El plan en esta ocasión es continuar explorando *Ruby on Rails*, mi framework favorito de momento, para ir agregando cosas progresivamente según las necesidades del sitio.\r\n\r\nAhora, para inaugurar el nuevo blog, quise tomarme un poco de tiempo para responder una de las preguntas que más me hice hace algunos años y que más recibo en la actualidad: ¿cómo comenzar en seguridad informática?.\r\n\r\n**\"Learn All The Things\"**\r\n\r\n*_Aprende todas las cosas_*, es quizás una de las frases más motivantes que recibí hace poco, como respuesta a la pregunta \"Debería estudiar A o B\" (en referencia a ciertas técnicas de explotación de hardware). La respuesta fue “_siempre aprende todo lo que puedas_”.\r\n\r\nSi estas pensando en cambiar tu carrera hacia la seguridad informática lo más importante es reforzar tus bases, por ejemplo, si eres programador refuerza tus bases en redes, si eres administrador de sistemas trabaja en tus bases de programación.\r\n\r\nPara practicar lo mejor es utilizar “_Maquinas Virtuales_”, en las que puedes simular varios sistemas operativos sin modificar la configuración actual de tu computador. [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), es la mejor opción siendo gratuito y con la que podrás instalar cualquier sistema operativo  directamente en el escritorio de tu sistema actual. Aprovechando esto vamos con el siguiente punto: LINUX.\r\n\r\n**Kali Linux**\r\n\r\nLo más importante a la hora de trabajar con las multiples herramientas de seguridad es que entiendas y manejes bien el sistema operativo GNU/Linux, sobre todo el terminal de comandos que, al principio, puede parecer intimidante para algunos, pero con un poco de práctica vas a dominar todos los conceptos básicos.\r\n\r\nUna vez logres sentirte cómodo con el terminal, el siguiente paso es aprender a como trabajar con redes, desde cosas tan simples como gestionar tu dirección IP desde la interfaz de comandos, hasta tus primeros escaneos de puertos con la herramienta NMAP. \r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n\r\nSi hablamos de lenguajes de programación que realmente valen  la pena aprender, Python debe estar en el top del listado de forma indiscutible. Se pueden simplificar y automatizar una cantidad de tareas y es el más popular a la hora de escribir “Fuzzers” o “Exploits”.\r\n\r\nLa inversión de tiempo en dominar este lenguaje tendrá resultados inmediatos en tu productividad, además de que podrás entender más fácilmente el código escrito por otros e investigar a fondo cómo fue que lograron detonar cierta vulnerabilidad, o cómo lograron automatizar un completo sistema de respaldos, entre otros.\r\n\r\n**¿Como sabré que estoy listo(a)?**\r\n\r\nEl cambio no sucederá de la noche a la mañana, requiere preparación y tiempo, o terminarás siendo solo un Script Kiddie más, utilizando códigos aleatoriamente sin entender el proceso de fondo.\r\n\r\nUna vez hayas reforzado tus bases, y consideres que tienes un dominio bastante sólido de los conceptos que he mencionado, busca cosas como \r\n[DVWA - Damn Vulnerable Web Application](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/),  y tutoriales para solucionar los distintos niveles. Este puede ser un interesante punto de entrada para la explotación de sistemas y páginas web, con conceptos que van desde Local File Inclusion hasta SQL Injection.\r\n\r\nSi estas listo para “_LEVEL UP_”, [Vulnerable By Design ~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) es la siguiente parada. Contiene una buena cantidad de máquinas virtuales listas para utilizar con tu Virtual Box (o VMware en algunos casos), donde podrás iniciar sistemas operativos completos con distintos problemas de seguridad que debes ir explotando para tomar el control del computador. \r\n\r\nLo mejor de este sitio son los “_Walkthroughs_”, guías para resolver cada máquina. Más de una vez aprendí distintas técnicas siguiendo los pasos de alguien que ya resolvió los distintos desafíos.\r\n\r\n**En fin**\r\n\r\nPaciencia, tiempo, constancia y dedicación, para ir cada día practicando y aprendiendo algo nuevo que te llevará por el camino que deseas que tome tu carrera en el futuro.\r\n", "tag_list"=>"personal, infosec"}, "commit"=>"Save & Publish", "id"=>"16"}
